Day 1:
- Random map generation
- player character can move around the map
- Different terrain types (road, empty plain, forest, hills, mountains, water)
- Randomized loot that a can affect stats or do special things
 (bypass terrain)
- Loot is selected from 3 random choices
- the random choices will not repeat
- The special items will not appear again once you take them
- Terrain has different effects (block movement, block vision, enhance vision, limit vision, slow you down, speed you up, etc)
- An attempt to avoid softlocks
- Step counter until the end of the loop
- Our stats generally planned out
- Line of sight implemented and working fully now

Day 2 (Plan):
- Add combat
 random encounters
 boss fight itself
- Possibly day/night cycle
- Add proper items/loot
- Add reset loop logic for when losing or beating boss
- Add ability to cary over some equipment
- Add ability to see equipment and what they do
- For stats
HP is obvious
Armor is damage reduction (flat) but doesn't restore normally
Speed: If you outspeed the enemy enough you get extra attacks (like FE)
Build: Weapon loot should require certain "Build" stat or others as requirements. Build allows you to use larger weapons. If you do not meet the requirements for build you can use it but it subtracts from your speed. And enemies could end up getting extra attacks on you instead.
Damage self expanitory
Vision also self expanitory


Day3 (Plan):
Make menus (including options)
Make art for the actual game part
Keep adding new items, enemies, loot, etc

Day 4(Plan):
Music
Sound effects
Polish and test

Day 5(Plan):
Test and fix issues
Setup the itch.io page
